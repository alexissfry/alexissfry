I'm Alexis, and I'm a sophomore at Brown University studying Computer Science! I'm also pursuing a certificate (aka minor) in Entrepreneurship. I'm an impact-focused individual who loves to create cool products (check some of them out below!) and build communities focused around diversifying tech, like [Creatica](https://www.creatica.io/).
